          <p class="pt-5 pr-5 text-sm">Feedback role is a tool that will help design student achieve a more engaging and effective feedback session. The main concept of the design is your participants will be assigned a role which they will be giving feedback according to the role they got. The tool is designed to serve both online and offline scenario. If you’re set up an on-site feedback session, you can explore the role on this site and download a pdf version to be used in your session.

            <h2 class="font-bold"> Design student </h2>
<p>The reason we picked student as our main target group is that the project they’re working on often don’t have a real client to give them feedback. Meanwhile, when they’re looking for feedback, they usually turn to friends. From what mentioned, we expect that this tool can help project owner to gain more useful feedback from their friends, also allow the participant to learn how to provide comprehensive feedback.</p>
