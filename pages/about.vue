          <p class="pt-4 pr-6 text-sm">Feedback role is a tool that will help design student achieve a more engaging and effective feedback session. The main concept of the design is your participants will be assigned a role which they will be giving feedback according to the role they got. The tool is designed to serve both online and offline scenario. If you’re set up an on-site feedback session, you can explore the role on this site and download a pdf version to be used in your session.

<p>The reason we picked student as our main target group is that the project they’re working on often don’t have a real client to give them feedback. Meanwhile, when they’re looking for feedback, they usually turn to friends. From what mentioned, we expect that this tool can help project owner to gain more useful feedback from their friends, also allow the participant to learn how to provide comprehensive feedback.</p>

         <p class=" text-sm pr-6 pb-20 pt-4">There is some insight that we found during our research. Design student’s feedback session often not that effective as it could be. This is caused by many factors—first, the overwhelming data of the presentation, which made participants hard to focus and lost attention. Second, the participants need some times to filter the information before being able to give out some advice. We have tested several methods before we decide to go with this one. By giving out people a role, allow them to focus only on the specific area, which help them filter the information quicker. Furthermore, they got a chance to challenge themselves by giving feedback on the area that they might not have considered before, such as business or sustainable aspect.</p>
